    "Q1.Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "ANS:  Functions helps to divide the large programs into small groups so that we can read the code, and debug the program faster and better. Python functions stop us from writing the same logic various times. We can bind the logic in one def and then call the same over and over. Many persons can work on the same program by assigning different methods to each of them. It encourages us to call the same method with different inputs over multiple times. Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes program shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n"
